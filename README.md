### What is This?

This is a docker that automatically downloads the v8 source code. You can submit it directly to [dockerhub](hub.docker.com), and it will automatically fetch v8 for you.

### Why This?

In China, it is very difficult to compile the v8 source code. This is because the agent cannot be configured when depot_tools fetch v8, which causes the v8 download source code to be very slow or unable to download.

### How to build it?

Visit [v8_build](https://github.com/mrh929/v8_build) for a suitable version and also submit it directly to [dockerhub](hub.docker.com).
